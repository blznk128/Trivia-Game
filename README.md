# TriviaGame
Overview
In this assignment, You'll create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Be sure to layout this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.

This is a trivia game app, you click the start button then answer the following questions before the timer ends! If you finish early, there is a done button and it will take you to the results page.  I based my trivia game on a game I used to play a ton, world of warcraft.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JQuery, and Bootstrap for that extra icing on the cake.
